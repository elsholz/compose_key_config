# Compose Key Config
This git repository contains my compose key file and will later contain a small Python script for generating this file dynamically.

To use the compose key configuration do the following:
1. Configure the compose key on your system
2. Run the following command: <br>
`user@device:~$ cp <path>/<to>/<repo>/.XCompose ~/`<br>
This will copy the config file to your home directory. If you made a config file earlier, be sure to back it up, as it will be overwritten.
<br>Alternatively you can also just execute `make_config.py` and it generates and replaces (or creates) `~/.XCompose` automatically. `make_config.py` can also write the config to stdout, use the `--stdout` option for that, or `-s` for short.    
3. Log off and log in again, have fun!
